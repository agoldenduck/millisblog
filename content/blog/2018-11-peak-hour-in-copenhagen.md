title: Peak hour in Copenhagen

I’m still getting myself oriented in Copenhagen. Alex seems to carry a compass inside his brain at all times but I take some time working out where things are. Luckily in Copenhagen I can look for the stream of bicycles travelling to or from the city to help me locate the centre. 

This afternoon we’re discussing the ratio of cars to bicycles on the road. The handy leaflet I picked up in the bike shop tells me that nearly all Copenhagen households own a bicycle but only 30% own a car!

“It’s a lot quieter today than yesterday at peak hour,” I observe.

“Well, we’re out later today,” says Alex. “I think peak hour is almost over.”

I check the time. It’s twenty past five.

title: No introvert is an island

Alex looks at me, a little puzzled, as I rant about how great our first Danish class was, flinging my arms around to add emphasis. It’s late and he wants to go to bed but I’m buzzing.

“So other than tonight,” he says slowly, “When was the last time you talked to someone in person?”

I thought about it for a moment. Other than Alex, and a few awkward ‘tak’s when I buy groceries, I haven’t spoken to a real life person since we came to Denmark.

“Do you think, perhaps, you might need to make some…you know… friends?” He asks tentatively.

He has a point. Despite being on the extreme end of the introvert spectrum, this is the most alive I’ve felt since we arrived in Denmark. Turns out hermits like me need community too, so I spend the next week joining every group that will take me (and speak English to me). Soon I’m a volunteer at a cosy non profit café, a member of a warm and welcoming international church, a singer in a choir and a member of a board games group. It's nerve wracking, but as things change over the next few weeks, I learn my first major lesson about good living in Denmark. Basically, it’s not the beauty of the city, the efficiency of the services or even the great biking lifestyle that makes life feel full. It’s the act of sharing it all with others. 

Surprisingly quickly, I find I have friends who I can talk to and laugh with and ask for advice about cold weather clothing and Danish pronunciation. They are diverse and wonderful. I know it’ll be a while before we know each other well and I still miss my friends back home. But somehow the grey Danish sky doesn’t feel so sad and lonely anymore. The clouds take on quite a different hue when viewed from inside a cosy café with a friend.

Getting our own bicycles seems like an important step in our Danish journey. It’s akin to a right of passage. As we rush around taking care of more urgent matters - bed sheets, toilet paper, clean laundry - we pause to gaze wistfully at the streams of cyclists whizzing past us, their (almost always) blonde hair rippling gently in the wind. Alex practically drools each time we pass a bike shop. As the whirlwind of arrival gradually subsides, we find an afternoon to go shopping.

After traipsing around the city for hours we return to the first bikes we saw, of course. Mine is white. I was hoping for a more fun colour, but apparently everyone wants a fun colour so they cost twice as much. I’m delighted to discover the benefits of a ‘ladies style’ bicycle, which means you can dismount gracefully at the front instead of contorting yourself as you try to swing your leg over the back and keep your skirt down at the same time. I love it instantly.

I make small talk with the shop owner while Alex test rides a few. 

“This is a good bike.” He tells me. “Unless you really know what you’re doing – no offence intended – it’s best to keep it simple.”

I assure him I am not offended by his very accurate assessment that I don’t know what I’m doing. 

“I like cycling, but just to get from place to place,” I say. “Nothing serious.”

“Yes, Danes also enjoy cycling just to get from place to place,” He replies. “All the time, everywhere, every day.”

Unfortunately it's peak hour when we ride home. I paste a smile on my face to try and look relaxed as I do my best not to imagine my bike and I being mangled together by a speeding bus. Once I get used to it I realise it’s actually not that hard. In fact, it’s kind of fun. By the time we near home I’ve got that glowy exercise-and-fresh-air feeling. I still need to work out how to indicate without wobbling though.

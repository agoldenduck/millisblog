I start watching Borgen, which is kind of like a Scandi West Wing with more women. Yes! (Anyone who hasn’t already watched Borgen should stop reading this blog and go and start it right now. I’ll see you again in 30 hours). Naturally, the main character, Birgitte Nyborg, becomes my new hero. I immediately start trying to learn how to get on my bike like she does. To be fair, it’s not just her who does it. I see Danes everywhere deftly balancing on one pedal as they push off and mount the already moving bike. After some careful observation, I decide it can’t be too difficult.

1. Miraculously have your bike pedals in the right place to start with. It looks very uncool to carefully wheel your bike back and forth until they’re in the right position.
2. Step on to your left pedal with your left foot. Don’t mess this up and step on with your nearest foot or you will turn yourself into a pretzel.
3. Push off and somehow balance on the pedal as the bike picks up speed. Don’t, under any circumstances, look stressed as you do this or it ruins the whole effect.
4. Without toppling over, swing your right leg under so you’re sitting on the seat.
5. Look like this feat of balance was no big deal and cycle off on your way. 

Needless to say, it doesn’t come naturally to me. I wobble around for about 40 minutes before I pull it off for the first time. I am ridiculously proud of myself. The next step is to graduate to an actual road, and perhaps to stop yelling in gleeful surprise every time I manage to do it successfully.

Autumn colours creep into the city and I’m entranced. Where I live in Sydney, there are really only a handful trees that lose their leaves. For the most part, Autumn means I start wearing a cardigan when I walk to work in the morning. Here, we ride past piles of glossy, fallen chestnuts and trees with foliage from amber to burgundy. I start a chestnut collection, and comb the grass for pinecones and particularly beautiful leaves, admiring their colours and textures. I’ve always taken solace in nature, but it’s a long time since I’ve been really present like this. It’s not that it’s more beautiful than home – goodness knows Sydney is one of the most stunning cities in the world. The difference is that I have so much more capacity to enjoy it. There’s no perpetual to do list buzzing through the back of my mind or anxious thoughts about the upcoming week to distract me from the present moment. I’m not sure how to hang onto this when the adventure ends and I go back to fulltime work, but I’d sure like to try.

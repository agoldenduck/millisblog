The sky is grey for the fifth consecutive day, making me yearn for the technicolour blue skies of Sydney. I stare out the window, feeling flat, the unending grey clouds making my isolation in the new city seem somehow more acute. My best friend loves grey skies. She’s studying in Sydney with the blinds closed against the sunshine. She sends me a voice message, describing the beauty she sees in drab weather in the hope that I can learn to see it too. It’s a generous gesture and I try my best to embrace her way of seeing. It’ll be a long winter if I don’t. For now I take to wearing brighter colours than I normally would, and sit under a lamp to write.

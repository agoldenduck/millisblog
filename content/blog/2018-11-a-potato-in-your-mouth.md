title: A potato in your mouth

Before coming to Denmark, I heard people joking that Danes speak as though they have a potato in their mouth. I laughed along, sure they were exaggerating. That was until my first Danish language class.

I try to copy the words my friendly volunteer teacher is saying, making at least 8 attempts before I can achieve even close to the sound he is making. It seems to require keeping your tongue stuck down at the back of your throat, and skipping half the syllables. Suddenly, the potato thing starts to make sense. 

He writes down a phrase and sends me to get a jug of water from the bar. Amazingly, they work out what I’m saying and hand me a jug of water. Though it’s possible they read the piece of paper. 

“Did I say it right?” I ask hopefully. 

“Errr,” she responds, then shows me how to do it properly.

I try to copy, and choke a little in the process.

“Yeah,” she laughs, “That’s just Danish.”

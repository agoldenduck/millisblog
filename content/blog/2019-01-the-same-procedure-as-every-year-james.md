We sit in our friends’ apartment on New Years Eve, staring in utter bafflement at the TV. On it, a black and white comedy plays. In English. The assortment of Danes and more seasoned expats around us recite the lines with delight.

“The same procedure as last year, Miss Sophie?” Asks the butler, and all our friends along with him.

“The same procedure as every year, James,” the elderly woman replies, along with the rest of our party.

I look at Alex. What on earth is going on? The Danes don’t seem to be able to explain it either. As far as I can tell, the only reason everyone watches the comedy short on New Years Eve is that it’s already been done for decades. In other words, it’s the same procedure as every year.

The more I think about it, the more this seems to encompass the entire Danish approach to the holiday season. We quickly learn there are traditions and procedures to be followed for every event. 

Let’s start with Christmas. As the light fades on Christmas Eve, a hush of anticipation seems to fall over the city. Even us Aussies, who only sort of celebrate the twenty fourth, can feel it. The bells ring out as we ride to our friend’s house for a proper Danish celebration. It appears to be a regular, if particularly hygge, Christmas dinner until the tree gets pulled out into the middle of the room and the electrical chord is carefully flattened against the floor. The Dane instructs us all to join hands and we dance around the tree singing songs we only half remember the words to. Then there’s a train that goes all around the house accompanied by a rousing Danish song. We try to keep up but all end up laughing.

Then New Years rolls around after a week of bleaker than usual weather. I don’t normally like New Years very much. In Sydney it consists of trying to get as close to the harbour as possible to watch the fireworks display, which would be fine if tens of thousands of other people weren’t all trying to do the exact same thing. The glitz wears thin when you can’t find a loo and public transport queues snake around the block, especially for an introvert like me who doesn’t like crowds. So it’s a little reluctantly that I accept an invitation from some Danish friends to celebrate with them. But New Years in Denmark couldn’t be more different. 

The celebration turns out to be a cosy gathering. More candles and cocktails than wild party. We watch the queen’s speech, play games then set off our own fireworks with the rest of the neighbourhood. We walk to the lakes for midnight and the Danes make us laugh by leaping off a park bench as the countdown ends, literally jumping from the old year to the new. There are traditional midnight marzipan biscuits. Then, as more and more people drift out from jumping off their couches, the fireworks start to ramp up. Soon the horizon explodes with colour and showers of gold sparks bounce off the surface of the water. It’s relentless. And loud. After about forty minutes, our Danish friend suggests we head home for tea. “There’s no point waiting for it to end,” she calls over the racket. “It’ll go on like this for hours.”

As we walk back through the crowded streets I realise there’s a huge grin on my face, despite the crowds. Perhaps even because of them. The joy is infectious. 

I think the thing about all the traditions and rituals is that they shift the focus on the holidays. Denmark isn’t immune from the commercialism that surrounds the holidays in other countries. But all the shared traditions bring human connection right to centre stage. Singing dorky songs around a Christmas tree raises family bonding to a whole new level. Reciting old British comedies to each other – not to mention lighting enough fireworks to blow up the neighbourhood – puts the focus of New Years on sharing the joy with loved ones, not getting invited to the most glamorous party. 

As we walk home through falling confetti I suggest to Alex that we try a few of these traditions in Australia. He’s floating on cloud nine and couldn’t agree more. Looks like we’ll be following the same procedure as every year too.

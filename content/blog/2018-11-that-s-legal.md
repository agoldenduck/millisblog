title: That's legal?

We decide to get to know the city better and embark on a walking tour. It’s a beautiful sunny day, so I leave my coat at home and we bike into town. Can you guess how this ends?

Our wonderful guide takes us all over the city and we learn all about the castles and spires we’ve been admiring for so long. My favourite facts, though, are about obscure Danish laws. For example, since the Swedes snuck across the frozen sea to invade Denmark in 1658, Danes have been legally allowed to pick up a stick and hit anyone who does this. While I don’t think violence towards Swedes is a good idea, I just love the odd specificity of this law.

After being caught by cloudbursts – sudden downpours of icy rain which soak through our clothes in minutes – I make a new rule of my own. Never, ever, leave the house without my coat, no matter how sunny it looks outside.

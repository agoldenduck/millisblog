It started as a big adventure. Alex signed up for exchange, I asked my boss for six months leave and we started devouring every scandi themed book and article we could lay our hands on. We read all about Danish hygge and made lists of all the amazing places we might like to visit. I did a deep dive into research on weather patterns, dreaming, like Bing Crosby, of a white Christmas. 

As the years passed, the idea of our big adventure became something more. Though I loved my job, the stress was getting to me. I was sick all the time. Alex tried to balance fulltime uni with fulltime work and we both found ourselves constantly exhausted, rushing around just to stay on top of things, prioritising badly and hustling to find the time and energy to see the people we loved. Without really noticing, I began to think of our adventure as a second chance. It was about having fun, yes, but also about taking a step back, rethinking things. 

As luck would have it, Denmark seemed like the perfect place for this. There have been entire books written about the Danes’ famous quality of life. (Helen Russell’s Year of Living Danishly as a great place to start). It turned out we’d accidentally signed up for exactly what we needed.

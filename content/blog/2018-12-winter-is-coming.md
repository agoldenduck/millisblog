Our favourite bar in Copenhagen is in a little copper watchtower on Knippelsbro, the bridge that spans across the harbour from our part of town. From there you can watch the sun set over the domes and spires of the city with a glass of wine in hand. I especially love it on clear evenings when the sun shines on the water and the clouds are gilded in pink and gold. It’s one of my favourite places. 

One Saturday in November the clouds part around lunchtime and patches of blue sky begin to peek through. I suggest the weather is ideal for the bridge tower. Alex heartily agrees.

“What time is sunset?” I ask him.

Alex checks the weather app on his phone. Then his eyebrows shoot up in consternation.

“Ummm,” he says.

“What?”

“Sunset is at 3.45pm,” he says.

“Sorry, what?” I say.

“It’s at 3.45,” he repeats. “We’ll have to leave ours by 3.30 to make it in time.”

I stare at him, flabbergasted. How can ‘sunset drinks’ be at a time more commonly associated with ‘afternoon coffee’? No wonder I’ve been feeling so sleepy lately. Every night I’ve been checking the clock three or four times in the early evening, repeatedly astonished that it’s so long till bedtime. 

We cut the afternoon short and cycle off for our drink at 3.30, only just making it in time. The sunset it glorious though. We talk and laugh while the seagulls squawk and the cyclists whizz across the bridge beneath us. We stay out well into the night, and return home late. 

“Wow, what time is it,” I say, stifling a yawn as we ride towards home.

“8pm,” says Alex. 

I gawp at him. So much for our big night out. Hibernation is looking like an increasingly realistic option for January.

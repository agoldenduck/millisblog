Before coming to Denmark, I heard people joking that Danes speak like they have a potato in their mouth. I laughed along, not really sure what they meant. Surely they're exaggerating, I thought. That was until my first Danish language class.

We sit around a table and I try to copy the words my friendly volunteer teacher is saying, making at least 8 attempts before I can achieve even close to the sound he is making. It seems to require keeping your tongue stuck down at the back of your throat, and skipping half the syllables. Suddenly, the potato thing starts to make sense.

My teacher writes down a phrase and sends me to get a jug of water from the bar. I read it out to the extremely patient bartenders and, amazingly, they hand me a jug of water.

“Did I say it right?” I ask hopefully.

“Errr,” she responds, then shows me how to do it properly.

I try to copy, and choke a little in the process.

“Yeah,” she laughs, “That’s just Danish.”

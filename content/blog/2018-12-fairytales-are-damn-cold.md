The Christmas trees are popping up, the streets are decked with real pine branches and the whole of Copenhagen twinkles with fairy lights. Little red huts appear in the square under a glittering sign that says ‘Christmas Markets’. I walk around town with my eyes wide and mouth hanging open in wonder, drinking in the heady scent of gløgg and sugared almonds. I feel as though I’ve stumbled in to a fairytale version of Christmas that I didn’t realise existed outside of snowglobes and Christmas cards. 

In fact, the fairytale vibe extends even beyond the glow of the Christmas Markets. I walk through the forest one afternoon and find the trees, now bare, are covered in moss.  The lakes have turned a deep, steely blue and the swans look magical as they glide around nibbling at the reeds.

Unfortunately, this particular fairytale is quite cold. Extremely cold in fact. It’s the sort of cold that seeps through your layers of clothing and the soles of your shoes, making your toes ache if you spend too long outdoors. It turns ‘going to the grocery store’ into an activity that takes twenty minutes to get properly dressed for. But it’s worth it. The drop in temperature only magnifies the pleasures of snuggling indoors or enjoying a glass of hot gløgg. Plus the fairylights look so pretty shining through the gloom. 

I mean, there is the matter of the wind stinging your face when you ride, and the way it makes your eyes stream with tears so you can’t see the traffic. Not to mention the sore, red patches of skin which have appeared around the sides of my nose or the eczema on my hands. But it’s great, really. A living fairytale. Did I mention the Christmas lights are beautiful?

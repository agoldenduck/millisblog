It doesn’t quite feel real. After years of dreaming, saving and planning, Alex and I are actually in Copenhagen. We wander around, looking for breakfast with our eyes wide and our mouths gaping. Within minutes, we fall head over heels in love with the city.

“There are bike paths everywhere!”

“That’s soooo great!”

“Look at all the greenery!”

“It’s soooo great!”

“Aren’t the scandi style houses beautiful?”

“They’re soooo great!”

We find a spot for breakfast before going to deal with the housing office at the uni. They have vegan options marked in English on the menu, the height of luxury after trying to avoid lactose in dairy-loving France. We order a delicious spread – dark rye bread, bacon, avocado – and watch the street go by.

“This is delicious.”

“It’s soooo great!”

“Everyone is so friendly.”

“It’s soooo great!”

Only when we get the bill does our bubble of bliss come crashing down. Alex stares at the currency converter in disbelief.

“This is NOT so great,” he says.

Our breakfast comes in at 75 Australian dollars. We add a new job to our to our morning to do list: collect our keys, find our new apartment, and visit the grocery store before lunch.

Getting our own bicycles seems like an important step in our Danish journey. It’s akin to a right of passage. As we rush around taking care of more urgent matters - bed sheets, toilet paper, clean laundry - we pause to gaze wistfully at the streams of cyclists whizzing past us, their (almost always) blonde hair rippling gently in the wind. Alex practically drools each time we pass a bike shop. As the whirlwind of arrival gradually subsides, we find an afternoon to go shopping.

After traipsing around the city for hours we return to the first bikes we saw, of course. Mine is white. I was hoping for a more fun colour, but apparently everyone wants a fun colour so they cost twice as much. I’m delighted to discover the benefits of a ‘ladies style’ bicycle, which means you can dismount gracefully at the front instead of contorting yourself as you try to swing your leg over the back and keep your skirt down at the same time. I love it instantly.

I make small talk with the shop owner while Alex test rides a few. 

“You picked a good bike.” He tells me. “Unless you really know what you’re doing – no offence intended – it’s best to keep it simple.”

I assure him I am not offended by his very accurate assessment that I don’t know what I’m doing. 

“I like cycling, but just to get from place to place,” I say. “Nothing serious.”

“Yes, Danes also enjoy cycling just to get from place to place,” He replies. “All the time, everywhere, every day.”

I realise I’m in over my head when we join the peak hour bike traffic heading home from the city. The bike lane is packed. Busses thunder past and I do my best not to imagine my bike and I mangled by a collision. After noticing passers by giving me concerned looks, I paste a smile on my face and try to look more relaxed. Perhaps it’s a matter of fake it till you make it, but by the time we arrive home I’m starting to enjoy myself. Though they sound scary, the cars and busses respect the bike lanes and I begin to trust that they’re not about to careen into us. We whizz past castles and canals, parks and cafes. By the time we near home I’ve got that glowy exercise-and-fresh-air feeling. I find myself looking forward to the next ride. I still need to work out how to indicate without wobbling though.

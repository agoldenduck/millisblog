I’ve been told not to get my hopes up for a white Christmas. Copenhagen is surrounded by water, which keeps the temperature milder here than it is in other places so far north. While this is ostensibly a good thing, I can’t help but be disheartened. I grew up singing along to Bing Crosby while the Christmas tree dried out in the summer heat. To me, the idea of a white Christmas is just as much a fantasy as flying reindeer and elves packing presents. I wish for snow with all my might. So when the temperature drops to five degrees Celsius I am delighted.

“Only five degrees less and it could SNOW!” I tell Alex as I pull on a thermal.

We cycle into town to meet friends who are visiting from London. It starts to drizzle as we reach Nyhavn, the famous canal lined with brightly coloured houses. The bare trees offer little shelter but we stand under them anyway while we wait. I stare at the rain and wish I’d remembered to put more water-proofing spray on my boots. The drops are rather large. They seem to shine in the weak sunlight. 

“The rain looks weird,” I say to Alex.

“Hmmm?” He replies.

“It’s kind of white.”

Alex looks at me skeptically, as though he knows exactly what I’m thinking. 

“It’s not snowing,” he tells me. “It’s still five degrees.”

“I know that,” I snap, disappointed. “I wasn’t saying it was snowing.”

This isn’t, strictly speaking, true. For a moment, I’d been filled with hope. But I realise, logically, that it’s impossible.

“I guess it could be hail,” Alex concedes.

But the more I look, the whiter the raindrops appear. What’s more, they’re falling slowly – much too slowly for hail. They even look too slow to be water. Barely daring to hope, I hold out a hand. A large, fluffy snowflake lands in the palm of my mitten. It shines against the black wool for a moment, then begins to melt.

“ALEX IT'S SNOW!” I yell, deranged with excitement.

I run out from under the trees and catch as many snowflakes as I can on my mittens. I must look ridiculous, but I don’t care at all. 

“But it’s five degrees!” says Alex, bemused. 

When we talk to local friends later on, they don’t seem particularly excited. It’s early for snow, they concede, but it melted straight away. It seems not to really count. For me though, it was magical. I think I’ll always remember the day I stood in Nyhavn and looked at the slow, white rain, hoping beyond hope it might be snow.

I completely panicked the first time Alex (then my new boyfriend, now my husband) suggested an overseas exchange. I like Australia. I love the bush, the beach and the scorching summer sun. I’m not the kind of person who has friends in far-flung corners of the world - my nearest and dearest are all in Sydney. Why would I want to leave? But seeing how important it was to Alex, I tentatively agreed.

As the years passed and the leaving date drew closer though, the idea of taking six months out took on a new lustre. I still loved Sydney and cared about my job but I was exhausted. All the time. Stress was causing health issues. I felt like I was rushing around just trying to stay on top of things, prioritising badly, barely finding time to see the friends I valued so much. Dragging myself to work in the mornings on too little sleep and too much coffee, I found myself asking ‘does it have to be like this?’

Enter the world’s ‘happiest country’ (though to be fair, Denmark is currently number 3 on the list). In Australia, Denmark was written about as the mecca of happiness; the land of hygge, great design and good living. I started to see our exchange as my chance to try a new way of life. Without me meaning it too, what started as a fun adventure became something much bigger.

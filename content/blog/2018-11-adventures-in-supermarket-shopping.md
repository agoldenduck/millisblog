I set off bravely for my first solo trip to the big supermarket. It’s a lot cheaper, and more confusing, than the friendly little ‘Irma’ market. Things go well to start with. I even find some rare vegetables that aren’t wrapped in plastic. After some frantic and fruitless googling about Danish supermarket etiquette, I get up the courage to ask a Dane whether I have to weigh the fresh produce myself. This tripped us up once or twice in France where you need to get a little barcode sticker to take to the check out. I hold up the apples and gesture towards the tiny weighing machine in the corner, but of course he has perfect English. 

“No, no.” He assures me. “You can just take them to the counter.”

Fantastic! One less thing to trip me up.

I approach the tills an inordinately long time later, having successfully located all the ingredients I need for dinner. The regular checkouts are all closed so there’s nothing for it but to tackle the self-service in Danish. I start to scan things and the machine blips along happily. When it comes to the carrots things get trickier. I can’t find where to look up fresh produce. I consider getting out my phone to translate every bit of text on the screen, but luckily the attendant spots me and swoops in to help.

“You have to get a sticker for those,” she tells me, pointing at the carrots. 

How confusing. I fumble around. Should I take back the things I’ve already scanned? 

“Go, go,” she tells me, standing to guard my little pile of groceries.

I trundle my trolley of fresh produce back up to the weighing machine in the fresh produce section. Now I that look more closely I see a tiny picture of carrots on one of the buttons. I put the carrots on the tray, press it and the machine spits out a barcode sticker. Success! 

I’m stumped by the tomatoes and the apples though. There are only two other buttons with pictures on them and they’re for cherries and potatoes. I don’t want to get a sticker for the wrong things. I look around but the section is suddenly deserted. I realise I’ll have to go back to the registers and ask the attendant for help, again. 

I trundle back and find her still minding my groceries. Gushing thanks and apologies, I explain my predicament.

“You can do the apples and tomatoes here,” she says, oblivious to how little sense this makes. Evidently deciding I need all the help I can get, she presses something on the self-serve register that brings up a list of fresh items and keys them in for me. 

I leave the supermarket in a new state of bafflement contemplating the possible reasons you might need a sticker for carrots, potatoes and cherries but not apples or tomatoes.

I realise, halfway home, that I’ve forgotten to get food for lunch. I can’t face a return to the big supermarket. I go and pay double at Irma instead.

Post script: It turns out most items in Danish supermarkets are priced per piece so you only need a sticker from the weighing machine if it’s priced per kilo, as carrots are. Live and learn. Also, when I told Alex about it he said “why didn’t you just press the English button on the self serve register?” 

Sigh.
